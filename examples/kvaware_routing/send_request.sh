    "prompt": "Elara stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind tugging at her cloak as the sea raged below. The letter in her hand trembled—not from the cold, but from the weight of its message. Her brother, missing for over a year, had left a trail of cryptic clues, and this final one brought her here, to the ruins of the Stormwatch Lighthouse. Once a proud sentinel of the coast, the lighthouse now stood abandoned, its light extinguished and its stone walls crumbling. Elara pressed forward, boots crunching against shattered tiles and wind howling through broken windows. Inside, the air was thick with dust and memory. She climbed the spiral staircase, each step creaking with forgotten stories. At the top, beneath the shattered lens of the beacon, she found it: a journal, wrapped in oilcloth, marked with her brother’s sigil. Hands shaking, she opened it. The pages revealed his descent into a secret organization sworn to protect a source of arcane energy buried deep beneath the sea, energy once used to light the coasts but now corrupted by misuse. He had gone to stop its awakening, fearing a catastrophe. But the last entry ended abruptly—he was going to seal the rift alone. Elara stared out over the cliffs, her decision forming like the storm clouds above. She would find the rift, finish what he started, and bring him home if he still lived. With resolve burning brighter than any beacon, she descended the tower, wind at her back, destiny ahead.",
